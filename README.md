# Roughcogs

Enhances the Discogs seller's page with some features I've always wanted.

Now you can sort the listings inline, without having to wait for page refresh, as well as sort by community data as 'Haves' and 'Wants'. Roughcogs also provides a cheap 'Ratio' value for sorting.

Todo: convert to a bookmarklet or Chrome extension in order to add it dynamically to any Discogs page.
